# Welcome to Optimal_EV_Chargers_Project Respitory!
Created by Prarthna Khemka, Shaurya Malik, and Omar Zu'bi.

### Project Description
16-week long group project to help companys find optimal charging locations based on US traffic volumes, with the end goal of maximizing revenue.

* Methodology: Simulating Annealing, Greedy Algorithms, Google Geo-Code API, Google Maps-Places API, Google Routing API, MySQL, R, HTML, CSS, PHP, JS
* Result: A web interface that users can log into and plan out optimal locations to place EV chargers. The web interface also included a live routing GPS for EV drivers to find the best route to the closest, available EV charger.

### Simulation Model
The group was tasked with creating an algorithm that will simulate projected traffic in all of the United
States, based on the traffic data spreadsheet provided and other sources. The goal of this is to create a
better estimation of traffic based on the traffic pattern acquired from past data. The further goal is to
rely less on the data spreadsheet and more on the projected estimation and to continually improve this
algorithm, adding more sources for better accuracy.

To simulate the data we first found which distribution fit the traffic the best, using the graph seen in
Figure 1., we noticed that beta was the best fit but beta is a distribution form 0 to 1, thus we used
gamma which was the next closest and used gamma distribution parameters found from the traffic data
given to us to generate the traffic for the next 5 years. The fit of gamma to the distribution can be seen
visually through Figure 2.
